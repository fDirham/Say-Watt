About:
Contained is an app that people can use to manage and activate SayWatt Toggle Devices through wifi. It was built in React-Native and is
only runnable through expo for the time being. It contains 3 main sections, a landing page with the logo, a tutorial section, and a main
app section. A list displays all the toggle devices connected to the app, where the data is stored locally, and users can add, delete, and
search for objects throughout the list.

SayWatt is the project created by Team 12 for IEEE Spring Quarterly Projects 2019. The team is made up of Fajar Dirham, Yifan Li, 
and Dominick Lee. The code here was written in react and contains most of the files necessary to run the project through expo 
(.expo is not included).
